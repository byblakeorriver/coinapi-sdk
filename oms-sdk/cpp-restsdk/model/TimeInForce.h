 * Lorem2 Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. ###Lifecycle Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. ###Lifecycle 2 Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

 * Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it is executed or expires. These options are especially important for active traders and allow them to be more specific about the time parameters.  | Parameter | Description | |-----------|--------| | &#x60;GOOD_TILL_CANCEL&#x60; | A Good-Til-Cancelled (GTC) order is an order to buy or sell a stock that lasts until the order is completed or canceled. Brokerage firms typically limit the length of time an investor can leave a GTC order open.  This time frame may vary from broker to broker.  Investors should contact their brokerage firms to determine what time limit would apply to GTC orders. | | &#x60;GOOD_TILL_TIME_EXCHANGE&#x60; | The GTTE (Good-til-Date/Time) time in force lets you select an expiration date and time up until which an order will continue to work. Setting this attribute requires both a time in force selection of GTD, a date entry in the Expiration Date field, and a time entry in the Expiration Time field if that level of detail is required. Note that if you only enter a good-till date, the unfilled order will cancel at the close of the market on the specified day. | | &#x60;GOOD_TILL_TIME_OMS&#x60; | The GTT (GTTO) supported by OMS. | | &#x60;FILL_OR_KILL&#x60; | Fill or kill (FOK) is a type of time-in-force designation used in securities trading that instructs a brokerage to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This type of order is most often used by active traders and is usually for a large quantity of stock. The order must be filled in its entirety or canceled (killed). | | &#x60;IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL&#x60; | An immediate or cancel order (IOC) is an order to buy or sell a security that executes all or part immediately and cancels any unfilled portion of the order. An IOC order is one of several \&quot;duration orders\&quot; that investors can use to specify how long the order remains active in the market and under what conditions the order is canceled. Other commonly used duration order types include fill or kill (FOK), all or none (AON) and good ‘till canceled (GTC). Most online trading platforms allow IOC orders to be placed manually or programmed into automated trading strategies. | | &#x60;AUCTION_ONLY&#x60; | This order will be added to the auction-only (AO) book for the next auction for this symbol. | | &#x60;INDICATION_OF_INTEREST&#x60; | An indication of interest (IOI) is an underwriting expression showing a conditional, non-binding interest in buying a security that is currently in registration—awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The investor&#39;s broker is required to provide the investor with a preliminary prospectus. However, IOIs in the mergers and acquisitions world has similar intent but is done differently. |  ##### Time in force options  | Exchange | GTC | GTTE | GTTO | FOK | IOC | AO | IOI | | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | BINANCE | X | X |  | X | X |  |  | | BITFINEX | X | X |  | X | X |  |  | | BITMEX | X | X |  |  | X |  |  | | BLOCKCHAINEXCHANGE | X | X |  |  | X |  |  | | BITSTAMP | X | X |  |  | X |  |  | | COINBASE | X |  | X | X | X |  |  | | GEMINI | X | X |  | X | X | X | X | | KRAKEN | X |  | X |  |  |  |  | | POLONIEX | X | X |  | X | X |  |  | | HITBTC | X | X |  | X | X |  |  | | KRAKENFTS | X | X |  |  | X |  |  |
